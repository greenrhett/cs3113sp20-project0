There should be no remaining bugs and running the program is just a matter of input file through stdin with any form of character in it. The characters occurence will be counted and sorted from least to most. There were many bugs in the making of the project whether that be segmentation faults from poorly sized char arrays, to the insert method not comparing current nodes to every node instead of just the first and last node. This was fixed by adding multiple strcmp to compare the current node to every node in the list. There were many other bugs in the making of this program but those were some of the more time consuming ones. I used many online sources including but not limited to geeks for geeks, stack overflow, reddit code threads, and I also spoke with my fellow classmates Coy Roles, and Isaiah Pugh, and Shilo on abstract ideas for the program. My only assumption for the solution is that it works.
